Implement a POST API with end point

That does following:
- HTTP Method should be POST
- end point should be /profile
- Data will be saved as JSON in a file named
`profile.txt` on the server. 
- The data will be overwritten
on every POST API call from Postman.

{
    "name": "your-name",
    "birthdate": "dd/mm",
    "city": "your-city"
}
